# THIS FILE IS DUPLICATED. THERE ARE TWO COPIES AND THEY MUST STAY BYTE-IDENTICAL.
#
#     idfkit/scripts/_governance_source.py
#     idfkit-developers/scripts/_governance_source.py
#
# Four callers read governance artifacts at a pinned tag, and feature 003 put them in two
# repositories: check_naming_register.py and check_parity_ledger.py are library gates and stayed
# with the library, while render_parity_page.py and render_naming_map.py act on the pages and
# followed the site.
#
# Duplication is the chosen answer, not an oversight. Publishing ~90 lines as a package would make
# a release cycle out of a file that changes twice a year, and a stale pin on it would be one more
# thing that can silently disagree. Moving it into idfkit-conformance would turn a data repository
# into a code dependency of both libraries, which is worse than a copy.
#
# The cost is real and is paid deliberately: A CHANGE TO ONE COPY MUST LAND IN THE OTHER IN THE
# SAME FEATURE. If they drift, the pinned read means two different things in two repositories, and
# a page and a gate can disagree about the same tag, which is exactly the failure this module was
# written to stop. tests/test_governance_source_matches.py compares them and blocks the merge.
#
# Note the banner is identical in both copies, naming both paths rather than "the other one".
# A header that pointed outward would make the files differ and defeat the comparison that keeps
# them honest.

"""Read a governance file at the immutable tag a release pins.

FR-081: governance is read at the ``governance-YYYY.N`` tag in
``[tool.idfkit.governance] level``, never from a branch and never from a working tree. A
moving source changes a verdict without any change landing in the repository being read,
which is the whole reason the pin exists.

Both page renderers claimed in their module docstrings that they did this, and neither did.
They read ``governance/*.toml`` straight off the sibling checkout, so ``--check`` passed or
failed on somebody's uncommitted edit, and a generated page could disagree with the two
things that *do* read at the tag: ``scripts/check_parity_ledger.py`` and the ``parity(id)``
documentation macro. A page and a gate that disagree is the failure the ledger header warns
about, committed in the tooling that renders the ledger.

Reading at a tag means the tag has to be fetched. That is a real new requirement for CI and
for a docs build, and it is the correct one: a build that quietly renders governance from
whatever happens to be on disk is worse than one that stops and says the tag is missing.

An explicit path is still honoured as a deliberate override, for a maintainer working on an
unreleased ledger, and it announces itself rather than passing silently for the pinned read.
