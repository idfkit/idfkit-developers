# HVAC templates

`HVACTemplate:*` objects are EnergyPlus's high-level HVAC shortcuts: one object expands into the dozens of low-level `ZoneHVAC:*`, `AirLoopHVAC`, `PlantLoop`, `Coil:*`, `Fan:*`, `Branch`, and `BranchList` objects that EnergyPlus actually simulates. For agent workflows this is the single highest-leverage feature in idfkit — you can stand up a runnable model with realistic HVAC in a handful of `doc.add()` calls instead of dozens.

## When to use

- You're building a model from scratch or modifying one and need HVAC fast.
- You want a plausible energy estimate without modelling every coil, fan, and pump.
- You're comparing HVAC system types with otherwise-identical models.

When templates aren't enough (custom topology, unusual controls, retrofits) drop to hand-authored `AirLoopHVAC` / `PlantLoop` — see [hvac-loops.md](hvac-loops.md).

## Quick start: fastest energy estimate

```python
--8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:quickstart"
```

## The four-tier layering

| Tier | What it does | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Thermostat** | Setpoints shared by zones. | `HVACTemplate:Thermostat` |
| **Zone** | One per conditioned zone — equipment that serves that zone. | `HVACTemplate:Zone:IdealLoadsAirSystem`, `:VAV`, `:FanCoil`, `:PTAC`, … |
| **System** | Air-side equipment that serves multiple zones (AHUs, DOAS). | `HVACTemplate:System:VAV`, `:UnitarySystem`, `:DedicatedOutdoorAir`, … |
| **Plant** | Water-side equipment (chillers, boilers, towers) and loops. | `HVACTemplate:Plant:ChilledWaterLoop`, `:HotWaterLoop`, `:Chiller`, `:Boiler`, `:Tower` |

Zone objects reference Systems by name; Systems reference Plants by name. Every Zone object references a Thermostat.

For full I/O Reference, see [docs.idfkit.com/io-reference/hvac-template-objects/group-hvac-templates/](https://docs.idfkit.com/io-reference/hvac-template-objects/group-hvac-templates/) or look up any individual type with `doc.describe("HVACTemplate:Zone:VAV")`.

## Worked example: full VAV + ChilledWater + HotWater system

```python
--8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:worked-example"
```

Then run the simulation with expansion enabled — see below.

## Expanding templates

Templates must be expanded into low-level objects before EnergyPlus can simulate them. You have three options:

### Option 1 — let `simulate` handle it (recommended)

```python
--8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:expand-option1"
```

idfkit invokes `ExpandObjects` as a preprocessor and feeds EnergyPlus the expanded model. The original `doc` is untouched.

### Option 2 — expand explicitly via `doc.expand()` and inspect

```python
--8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:expand-option2"
```

Use this when you want to study what `ExpandObjects` produced or hand-modify the result.

### Option 3 — function-style

```python
--8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:expand-option3"
```

Equivalent to `doc.expand()`. Useful if you prefer free functions to methods.

All three require EnergyPlus to be installed (`ExpandObjects` is a C++ binary that ships with EnergyPlus). Discovery is automatic via `$ENERGYPLUS_DIR`, `$PATH`, or standard install locations.

## Enumerating templates already in a model

```python
--8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:enumerate"
```

`doc.hvac_templates` is the convenience accessor for the most common template (`HVACTemplate:Zone:IdealLoadsAirSystem`); the loop covers every template type.

## Why expansion is destructive

After `doc.expand()`, the resulting document has zero `HVACTemplate:*` objects — they've been replaced by their low-level expansions. This means:

- You can't edit the templates after expansion (they're gone).
- The expanded document is committed to the topology `ExpandObjects` produced.
- If you want to tweak the system, edit the **template** first, then re-expand.

The `simulate(doc, ..., expand_objects=True)` path expands a copy for EnergyPlus to consume but leaves your in-memory `doc` untouched, so you can re-run after editing the templates.

## Common mistakes

!!! failure "mixing templates with hand-authored ZoneHVAC on the same zone"

    ```python
    doc.add("HVACTemplate:Zone:IdealLoadsAirSystem", zone_name="Office", template_thermostat_name="OfficeT")
    doc.add("ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem", "Office Ideal Loads", zone_supply_air_node_name="...")
    # ExpandObjects produces another ZoneHVAC:IdealLoadsAirSystem — now you have two,
    # the zone is double-conditioned, results are nonsense.
    ```

!!! success "pick one approach per zone"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:mistake-mix-good"
    ```

!!! failure "simulating without expansion"

    ```python
    result = simulate(doc, "weather.epw")      # expand_objects defaults to True, but if you opted out:
    result = simulate(doc, "weather.epw", expand_objects=False)
    # .err contains "HVACTemplate:Zone:VAV is an invalid object type"
    ```

!!! success "let `simulate` expand for you"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:mistake-simulate-good"
    ```

!!! failure "expecting `doc.expand()` to mutate"

    ```python
    doc.expand()                               # discarded — expand() returns a new document
    simulate(doc, "weather.epw", expand_objects=False)   # original still has templates
    ```

!!! success "capture the return value"

    ```python
    --8<-- "docs/snippets/agent_references/hvac-templates.py:mistake-expand-good"
    ```

## When to drop down

If you outgrow templates — needing custom controllers, unusual topology, plant interactions templates can't express — author `AirLoopHVAC` / `PlantLoop` directly. See [hvac-loops.md](hvac-loops.md).
