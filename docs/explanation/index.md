# Explanation

Explanation is the discussion of a topic: how idfkit works under the hood, why
it was designed the way it is, and how the pieces relate. These pages are worth
reading away from the keyboard, when you want to understand rather than to do.

They deliberately don't tell you which buttons to press — that's the job of the
[How-to guides](../how-to/index.md) — and they don't exhaustively list options,
which is the [Reference](../reference/index.md)'s job.

## Architecture & design

- [Simulation architecture](../concepts/simulation-architecture.md) — why
  simulations run in subprocesses on a copy of your model.
- [Weather data pipeline](../concepts/weather-pipeline.md) — how station search,
  downloads, and design days fit together.
- [Caching strategy](../concepts/caching.md) — what idfkit caches, and why.
- [How the schedule evaluator works](../design/schedule-evaluator.md) — how the
  pure-Python schedule engine resolves the Year → Week → Day hierarchy, and why
  it behaves as it does.
- [Geocoding & IP location](geocoding.md) — the free services behind address and
  "near me" lookup, and their accuracy and privacy trade-offs.

## Working effectively

- [Type-safe development](../concepts/type-safety.md) — how the generated type
  stubs give you autocomplete and catch typos.
- [Performance & benchmarks](../benchmarks.md) — how idfkit compares to eppy and
  other tools, and how those numbers were measured.
