"""The duplicated governance reader has not drifted from the library's copy.

``scripts/_governance_source.py`` exists twice, here and in ``idfkit/scripts/``. Four callers
read governance artifacts at a pinned tag and feature 003 put them in two repositories: the
library's naming and parity gates stayed with the library, the site's parity and naming
renderers followed the site.

Duplication was chosen over publishing ~90 lines as a package, which would make a release cycle
out of a file that changes twice a year, and over moving it into idfkit-conformance, which would
turn a data repository into a code dependency of both libraries. The cost is that the two can
drift, and if they do, the pinned read means two different things in two repositories: a page
and a gate can then disagree about the same tag, which is the exact failure the module was
written to prevent.

This test is what makes "must land in both" blocking rather than remembered.

WHY IT COMPARES BYTES AND NOT BEHAVIOUR. Behaviour is what matters, but behaviour is what a
diff cannot see. Two files that differ by a default argument are two files that agree on every
test anyone thought to write and disagree on the one nobody did. Bytes are the only comparison
with no gap in it, which is also why the banner at the top of both copies is identical and names
both paths rather than pointing at "the other one".
